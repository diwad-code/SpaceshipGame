## Quick Reference

### Skill Invocation
```bash
/skill image-analysis
```

### Direct Tool Call
```bash
mcp__4_5v_mcp__analyze_image --imageSource "[path]" --prompt "[prompt]"
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Validate Newly Generated Sprite

**Context:** glm-image-gen just created a new NPC sprite

```bash
# After generation completes
mcp__4_5v_mcp__analyze_image \
  --imageSource "assets/sprites/placeholders/npc_hermes.png" \
  --prompt "Analyze this 64x64 NPC sprite for Harvest Moon SNES style quality.

Target Proportions: ~48h x 32w centered (compact, not elongated)

Check For:
- Strong silhouette (recognizable at small size)
- Clean transparency (no halos or color bleeding)
- Mediterranean theme alignment (sky-blue tunic, gold trim, winged hat/sandals)
- Proper pixel art scaling (minimal noise, clear details)
- Dusk-friendly color palette (muted, not oversaturated)

Reference: assets/sprites/PLACEHOLDER_ASSET_SPEC.txt (item #13)

Provide specific feedback with P0/P1/P2 priority levels for any issues found."
```

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Analysis Summary
NEEDS WORK - Sprite has transparency issues

### Issues Found
**Critical (P0):**
- Halo effect around sprite edges (visible light ring on transparent background)
- Color bleeding in winged hat area (background pixels showing through)

**Important (P1):**
- Silhouette readable but could be stronger (caduceus staff blends into tunic)
- Colors slightly oversaturated for dusk theme

**Minor (P2):**
- Pixel art quality good overall
- Proportions match spec (~48h x 32w)

### What Works
- Compact body proportions (not stretched)
- Clear character design (Hermes recognizable)
- Good pixel density for 64x64

### Recommendations
1. Fix alpha channel: re-export with clean transparency edges
2. Darken tunic color by 15% for dusk-friendly palette
3. Add subtle outline to caduceus for better separation
```

### Scenario 5: Transparency Issue Diagnosis

**Context:** Specific focus on transparency problems

```bash
mcp__4_5v_mcp__analyze_image \
  --imageSource "assets/sprites/placeholders/moon_tear.png" \
  --prompt "Diagnose transparency issues in this sprite.

Check specifically for:
1. Halo effect - light or dark ring around sprite edges
2. Color bleeding - background color visible in transparent pixels
3. Harsh edges - no smooth curves on diagonal/curved pixels
4. Partial transparency - pixels that are semi-transparent (should be opaque or transparent)

Report:
- Severity: NONE / MINOR / MODERATE / SEVERE
- Location: specific pixel areas affected
- Recommendation: how to fix (re-export, alpha channel cleanup, etc.)
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Transparency Diagnosis

**Severity:** MODERATE

**Issues Found:**
1. **Halo effect:** Light grey ring visible around moon tear droplet edges
   - Location: All outer edges
   - Cause: Anti-aliasing created semi-transparent pixels

2. **Color bleeding:** Dark background pixels visible in transparent areas
   - Location: Bottom-right corner
   - Cause: Export with background color not fully removed

**Recommendation:**
Re-export sprite with:
- Hard edge transparency (no anti-aliasing on edges)
- Alpha threshold set to 128 (fully opaque or fully transparent)
- Clean background before export
```

### Scenario 6: Style Comparison

**Context:** Compare asset against Harvest Moon SNES reference

```bash
mcp__4_5v_mcp__analyze_image \
  --imageSource "assets/sprites/placeholders/wheat_crop.png" \
  --prompt "Compare this asset to Harvest Moon SNES style.

Harvest Moon SNES Characteristics:
- Clean pixel art with minimal noise
- Strong silhouette (recognizable at small size)
- Soft, natural color palette
- Proper alpha blending (no halos)
- No anti-aliasing on edges
- Cozy, approachable aesthetic

Report:
1. What matches Harvest Moon SNES style
2. What deviates from style
3. Specific recommendations to align closer to reference
4. Overall compatibility score (0-100%)
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
## Style Comparison

**Compatibility Score:** 85%

**Matches Harvest Moon SNES Style:**
- Clean pixel art with minimal noise ✓
- Strong silhouette - wheat sprout recognizable ✓
- Soft, natural colors (warm gold tones) ✓
- Cozy, approachable aesthetic ✓

**Deviates from Style:**
- Slight anti-aliasing on leaf edges (Harvest Moon uses hard edges)
- Could be slightly more detailed ( Harvest Moon crops have more detail at 32x32)

**Recommendations:**
1. Remove anti-aliasing on leaf edges for crisp pixels
2. Add 1-2 extra pixels of detail to wheat head for better readability
3. Consider slightly warmer yellow tone for better Harvest Moon feel

**Overall:** Good alignment with minor polish needed.
```

## Integration Examples

### With glm-image-gen Pipeline
```bash
cd .claude/skills/glm-image-gen

# Generate sprite
URL=$(./scripts/generate-image.sh '{"subject":"..."}' 1024x1024 standard)
TEMP=$(./scripts/download-image.sh "$URL")
OUTPUT=$(./scripts/process-image.sh "$TEMP" "32x32" "assets/sprites/output.png")

# Validate quality
cd ../../..
mcp__4_5v_mcp__analyze_image \
  --imageSource "assets/sprites/output.png" \
  --prompt "Validate newly generated sprite meets Circe's Garden spec. Check: transparency, silhouette, proportions, colors, pixel art quality."

# If FAIL, regenerate with adjusted prompt
```

### With HPV Screenshot Review
```bash
# During playtesting session
ls temp/screenshots/

# Analyze most recent screenshot
mcp__4_5v_mcp__analyze_image \
  --imageSource "temp/screenshots/latest.png" \
  --prompt "Screenshot quality check for HPV. Focus on: visual bugs, sprite issues, background problems, overall readability."
```

### Pre-commit Hook Pattern
```bash
# Before committing
git diff --name-only | grep "\.png$"

# For each modified PNG, run analysis
for file in $(git diff --name-only | grep "\.png$"); do
  echo "Validating: $file"
  mcp__4_5v_mcp__analyze_image \
    --imageSource "$file" \
    --prompt "Pre-commit validation. Check: transparency, silhouette, proportions. One-line: PASS/FAIL."
done

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Tool Returns Error
**Error:** "图片输入格式/解析错误"

**Solutions:**
1. Use forward slashes in path: `C:/Users/Sam/...`
2. Try file:// URL: `file:///C:/Users/Sam/...`
3. Use relative path: `temp/screenshots/file.png`
4. Verify file exists: `ls -la [path]`

### No Analysis Output
**Checks:**
- Image file exists at path
- Image is PNG or JPG (not SVG)
- MCP server is running
- Prompt is not empty

### Poor Quality Analysis
**Improvements:**
- Make prompt more specific
- Reference asset spec document
- Specify analysis type (screenshot vs sprite)
- Include priority levels (P0/P1/P2)
